* User's input is audio
## Server
The server software is developed in Python. It includes a pre-trained machine learning model and socket server that communicates with android app. More about the pre-trained machine learning model is [ðŸ¦„ here](https://medium.com/@Thomwolf/how-to-build-a-state-of-the-art-conversational-ai-with-transfer-learning-2d818ac26313).
## Client
The client application is developed in Java using Android Studio. Its Graphical User Interface consists of the following parts:
* **Icon** 
* **Splash Screen**  
* **Settings Window**  
* **Main Conversation Window**
