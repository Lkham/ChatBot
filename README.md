## AI ChatBot application for Android OS using JAVA socket
The goal of this assignment is to build an Artificial Intelligence based chatbot for Android smartphone.
The chatbot is built by the client-server model. The client side is a smartphone application and the server part is an artificial intelligence based bot.
## Features
* User's input is text
* User's input is audio
## Server
The server software is developed in Python. It includes a pre-trained machine learning model and socket server that communicates with android app. More about the pre-trained machine learning model is [ðŸ¦„ here](https://medium.com/@Thomwolf/how-to-build-a-state-of-the-art-conversational-ai-with-transfer-learning-2d818ac26313).

Server give us selected model personality, server ip address and port numbers as shown below. If the defualt port numbers are already taken, users can set their own port numbers that is not used.

  2. Install it on your device
  3. Run the application
  4. Enter server IP address and port numbers on the settings window
  
* Finaly it works as folows:
